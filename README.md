# Vizoros Super Peer
These are just some of the features of our Super Peer ...
+ It's Free.
+ First Class Peer to Peer Architecture
+ Peer to Peer decentralized container image(s) distribution. 
+ A secure and lean RESTful service architecture to integrate enterprise services.
+ Resilent service architecture that uses a try again approach to recover lost time.
+ Parallel processing (multicore), asychronous architecture, and various other optimizations.
+ Mitosis replication feature that allows every peer to spawn off an installation of more peers.
+ Docker images are compressed and encrypted for optimal decreased costs and secure network transfer.

# There are many other features, configurations, options, flexibilities, and extensibilities that are not mentioned.
